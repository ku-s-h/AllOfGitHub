#AllOfGithub

Cataloging GitHub. Check out the [blog](https://medium.com/@kushagrasingh/cataloguing-github-8a25466b2041) post for more details.

###Prerequisites

Create an OAuth GitHub app in order to get past the request rate limit to the API. The Client-Id and Client-Secret keys will be useful.

Tip- In place of **Homepage URL** and **Authorization callback URL** you can give your localhost address **http://127.0.0.1**

###Setup

```$ npm install``` to install the dependencies.

```config.json``` store all the configurations.

```$ node server.js``` starts the server.
